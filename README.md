# magic-maze

When I was in school, my best friend used to draw mazes on squared sheets. These mazes had teleportation places and tunnels and stuff.
This is my attempt to digitalize the idea so everyone can make their own mazes for their friends.

To create a maze, just create the text file with the maze, following these rules:
- the starting point is the @ character
- the exit/finish point is the $
- if you put a symbol that is not #, ' ', $ or @, then you must put another one somewhere else in the maze. These will act as portals, transporting the player to the other same symbol.
